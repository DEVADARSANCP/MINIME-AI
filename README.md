### Project Description
MiniMe is an interactive AI avatar that combines real-time voice interaction with a sassy, over-dramatic personality. Featuring text-to-speech capabilities and fluid animations, it creates engaging conversations while displaying dynamic visual responses through a sleek, modern interface. The avatar responds to both text and voice input with witty, energetic replies, making everyday interactions more entertaining.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are bored of polite, sensible virtual assistants. Life‚Äôs too short for ‚ÄúHow can I help you today?‚Äù when you could have an AI with some sass.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
the snarky, over-dramatic AI avatar who makes every interaction an experience. With voice, animations, and witty comebacks, MiniMe adds spice to your day and makes sure you‚Äôre never bored talking to a screen.

- [Tools used]

### Implementation
used google ai studio api to create the chat bot 
text to speech is done using the api key of elevenlabs
dlib (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.data) to extract facial features was from images ( created from scratch not accurate and couldnt use it here cos of the 3d issues so here its an image however i have uploaded the files)
# Installation
run the html file 
note : give your own api key in google api key in the script
https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (to create google api key)
https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys (to create a elevenlavs api key)

# Run
run the minime ai.html in web browser
