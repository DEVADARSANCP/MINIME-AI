### Project Description
MiniMe is an interactive AI avatar that combines real-time voice interaction with a sassy, over-dramatic personality. Featuring text-to-speech capabilities and fluid animations, it creates engaging conversations while displaying dynamic visual responses through a sleek, modern interface. The avatar responds to both text and voice input with witty, energetic replies, making everyday interactions more entertaining.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are bored of polite, sensible virtual assistants. Life‚Äôs too short for ‚ÄúHow can I help you today?‚Äù when you could have an AI with some sass.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The snarky, over-dramatic AI avatar who makes every interaction an experience. With voice, animations, and witty comebacks, MiniMe adds spice to your day and makes sure you‚Äôre never bored talking to a screen.

### Implementation
This MiniMe project utilizes several APIs to create a conversational AI with a (planned) 3D face.
Components:
* Google AI Studio API: Used to build the core conversational logic of the chatbot.
* ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API: Converts generated text into audio for a natural-sounding voice.
* dlib (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.data): (Not currently used) This library was intended to extract facial features from images for a planned 3D face, but limitations prevented its implementation.

### Installation
For a basic setup:
* Run the HTML file: Open index.html in your web browser. <br> API Keys: Obtain and replace the placeholder values in the script with your own API keys:
* Google AI Studio API Key: Create a new key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey. 
* ElevenLabs API Key: Generate a key from your ElevenLabs account settings: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech 

### Run
Once you've replaced the API keys and opened the HTML file, your MiniMe chatbot should be ready for interaction.

Note: The 3D facial features were not implemented due to technical limitations.
